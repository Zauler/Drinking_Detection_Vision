# Drinking_Detection_Vision

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and Haar Cascade for face detection to determine when a person is drinking mate. When the system detects that a person is bringing a mate cup close to their face, it plays a sound.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Detection**: Detects various objects including cups.
- **Haar Cascade Face Detection**: Detects human faces in real-time.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays a sound when the system detects that a person is about to drink mate.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video frames from the webcam in real-time.
